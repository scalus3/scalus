    /** Compiles a UPLC term into an optimized JVM function using JIT compilation.
      *
      * This method takes a UPLC term and generates optimized JVM bytecode that can be executed
      * directly without interpretation overhead. The resulting function maintains full
      * compatibility with Plutus VM semantics including proper budget tracking, logging, and error
      * handling.
      *
      * @param term
      *   The UPLC term to compile
      * @return
      *   A function that takes a Logger, BudgetSpender, and MachineParams and returns the
      *   evaluation result. The function signature is:
      *   `(Logger, BudgetSpender, MachineParams) => Any`
      * @example
      *   {{{
      * val term: Term = ... // some UPLC term
      * val jittedFunction = JIT.jitUplc(term)
      * val result = jittedFunction(logger, budgetSpender, machineParams)
      *   }}}
      * @note
      *   The compilation happens at runtime and may take some time for complex terms. The compiled
      *   function can then be cached and reused for better performance when evaluating the same
      *   term multiple times.
      * @throws RuntimeException
      *   if the term contains unsupported constructs or if compilation fails
