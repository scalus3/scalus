/** A MultiAsset is, semantically, a collection of associations [[PolicyId]]/[[AssetName]]/Quantity.
 *
 * The interpretation of this type is as follows:
 * - It can be thought of loosely as a `Map[PolicyId, Map[AssetName, quantity]]` with additional invariants.
 *   - We term the `Map` keyed by `AssetName` the "Inner Map".
 * - The `quantity` can be a bounded integer, unbounded integer, or rational number (see package docs for
 *   [[scalus.cardano.ledger.coin]].
 * - In both the inner and outer maps (the maps keyed by `AssetName` and `PolicyId`, respectively), "empty" values
 *   are removed from the map. This means that an `AssetName` with a quantity of zero will never appear in the inner
 *   map, and a `PolicyId` corresponding to an empty `Map[AssetName, quantity]`  will never appear in the outer map.
 *   - Thus, if a lookup for a specific `(PolicyId, AssetName)` fails, it can be semantically interpreted as "zero".
 *   - This allows the underlying map to have an algebraic interpretation, depending on the quantity. Specifically,
 *     [[MultiAsset.Unbounded]] is a [[CModule]], and [[MultiAsset.Fractional]] is a [[VectorSpace]]
 * - Both maps are sorted lexicographically. This is in accordance with the plutus + `cardano-ledger` representation.
 *   - This means that both the inner and outer maps have a [[PartialOrder]] defined
 *
