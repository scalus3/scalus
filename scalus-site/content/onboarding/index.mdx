## What to Expect

Each onboarding guide includes:

- **Phased Learning** - Progressive difficulty from quick start to production-ready
- **Interactive Checklists** - Track your progress through the material
- **Time Estimates** - Know how long each phase takes (30 min to 3 hours per phase)
- **Quick Wins** - Concrete achievements at each milestone
- **Curated Resources** - External learning materials for topics you need to learn

## Which Path Should I Take?

### Choose "For Scala Developers" if:
- ✓ You're comfortable with Scala 3 syntax
- ✓ You understand functional programming
- ✓ You're new to blockchain development
- ✓ You want to learn how Cardano works

**Time to first validator:** ~30 minutes
**Time to proficiency:** ~2-3 hours

### Choose "For Cardano Developers" if:
- ✓ You understand Cardano's eUTxO model
- ✓ You've written Plutus validators before (Haskell, Aiken, etc.)
- ✓ You're new to Scala
- ✓ You want to use professional tooling and debugging

**Time to first validator:** ~45 minutes (after Scala basics)
**Time to proficiency:** ~4-6 hours (including Scala learning)

## Still Deciding? Start Here

Start with **[For Scala Developers](/docs/onboarding/for-scala-developers)** if you have any Scala experience, even minimal. You'll pick up Cardano concepts faster than learning a new programming language.

Start with **[For Cardano Developers](/docs/onboarding/for-cardano-developers)** if you're already building on Cardano and want to switch to Scalus. The included Scala resources will get you up to speed quickly.
