# Blockchain Providers

The `Provider` trait is Scalus's abstraction for interacting with the Cardano blockchain. Providers allow you to send transactions and query blockchain state in a consistent way, regardless of whether you're working with a real blockchain, test node, or local emulator.

## Overview

The `Provider` interface provides methods for:
- Querying UTxOs by address, datum, or tokens
- Submitting CBOR-encoded transactions
- Retrieving transaction information
- Accessing blockchain state

## Available Providers

### Emulator

The `Emulator` implements the `Provider` trait but operates entirely locally, without any network connection. It provides:
- In-memory UTxO set management
- Local transaction validation using [ledger rules](/ledger/ledger-rules)
- Instant feedback without network delays
- Perfect isolation for testing

The Emulator is ideal for:
- Unit test suites
- Rapid development iterations
- Scenarios where launching a local node would be inconvenient

Learn more about the Emulator in the [Emulator documentation](/docs/testing/emulator).

### BlockfrostProvider

`BlockfrostProvider` connects to the Cardano blockchain via the Blockfrost API service. This provider is useful for:
- Verifying transactions and scripts against a real blockchain
- Testing against a test node (testnet, preview, preprod)
- Production deployments

Interacting with Blockfrost incurs network delays, making it less suitable for rapid development cycles or unit tests.

## Example Usage

Here's how you might use different providers interchangeably:

```scala
// Using Blockfrost for production
val blockfrostProvider = BlockfrostProvider(apiKey, network)

// Using Emulator for testing
val emulatorProvider = Emulator(
  Map(
    input(0) -> adaOutput(Alice.address, 100)
  )
)

// Same code works with both providers
def buildAndSubmit(provider: Provider) = {
  val tx = TxBuilder(testEnv)
    .payTo(Bob.address, Value.ada(10))
    .complete(provider, Alice.address)
    .await()
    .transaction

  provider.submit(tx).await()
}

// Works with Blockfrost
buildAndSubmit(blockfrostProvider)

// Works with Emulator
buildAndSubmit(emulatorProvider)
```

## Provider Methods

The `Provider` trait defines methods for interacting with the blockchain. Common methods include:

- `findUtxo(txIn: TxIn)`: Find a specific UTxO by transaction input
- `findUtxos(address: Address)`: Find all UTxOs at an address
- `submit(tx: Transaction)`: Submit a transaction for processing
- And more query methods for specific use cases

Check the API documentation for the complete list of available methods.
