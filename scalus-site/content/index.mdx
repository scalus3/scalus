**Scalus** is a development platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a unified environment where developers can write both on-chain smart contracts and off-chain logic using [Scala 3](/docs/language-guide/scala3) - a modern, expressive, and type-safe functional programming language.

## Why Scalus?

**One Language, Full Stack** - Write smart contracts and application logic in Scala 3. No context switching between Plutus/Haskell for contracts and JavaScript/Python for frontends.

**Type-Safe by Design** - Catch errors at compile time, not on-chain. Leverage Scala's powerful type system to prevent entire classes of bugs before deployment.

**Professional Tooling** - Debug validators with breakpoints in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code. Step through execution, inspect variables, and use the tools you already know.

**Battle-Tested Ecosystem** - Built on the JVM with access to thousands of proven libraries. Use ScalaTest for testing, Akka for concurrency, and the entire Scala ecosystem.

**Fine-Grained Control** - Advanced optimizations give you control over generated UPLC code. Reduce script size and execution costs with macros, inline optimizations, and direct Script Context access.

## Complete Development Lifecycle

- [Write Cardano smart contracts](/docs/smart-contract/developing-smart-contracts) in Scala 3 that compile to UPLC
- Optimize on-chain code with [advanced optimisation techniques](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations)
- [Debug Smart contracts](docs/smart-contract/debugging) as regular Scala code with your IDE's debugger
- Build and evaluate transactions off-chain with the transaction builder
- Integrate on-chain and off-chain components in your full-stack application
- [Test your entire application](docs/smart-contract/testing) with unit, integration, and property-based tests
- Verify your solution on a testnet with the familiar tools
- Deploy production-ready applications to mainnet with confidence

## Developer Experience First

Enjoy a modern development experience with excellent IDE support, comprehensive testing tools, and the [extensive Scala](https://index.scala-lang.org/) & JVM ecosystems.

Say goodbye to juggling multiple languages, libraries, and tools—meet Scalus, a development platform made for professionals and businesses who want to get things done.
