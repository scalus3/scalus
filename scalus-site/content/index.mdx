# Scalus Introduction

**Scalus** is a development platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a unified environment where developers can write both on-chain smart contracts and off-chain logic using [Scala 3](/docs/language-guide/scala3) - a modern, expressive, and type-safe functional programming language.

## Why Choose Scalus for Cardano Development?

### One Language, Full Stack
Write smart contracts and application logic in Scala 3. No context switching between Plutus/Aiken for contracts and JavaScript/Python for frontends and backends.

### Type-Safe by Design
Catch errors at compile time, not on-chain. Leverage Scala's powerful type system to prevent entire classes of bugs before deployment.

### Professional Tooling
Debug validators with breakpoints in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code. Step through execution, inspect variables, and use the tools you already know.

### Battle-Tested Ecosystem
Built on the JVM with access to thousands of proven libraries. Use ScalaTest for testing, Akka for concurrency, and the entire Scala ecosystem.

### Fine-Grained Control
Advanced optimizations give you control over generated UPLC code. Reduce script size and execution costs with macros, inline optimizations, and direct Script Context access.

## Development Workflow

- **Write** - [Smart contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/developing-smart-contracts) and off-chain logic in Scala 3
- **Test** - [Unit, integration, and property-based tests](/docs/testing) with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck
- **Debug** - [Step through validators](/docs/testing/debugging) with breakpoints in your IDE
- **Optimize** - [Reduce script size and costs](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations) with advanced techniques
- **Build** - [Construct transactions](/docs/transactions) with automatic fee calculation and balancing
- **Deploy** - Test on [local devnet](/docs/testing/local-devnet), then ship to mainnet

## Modern Development Experience

Built for professional developers and teams, Scalus provides:

- **Industry-Standard IDEs** - Full support for IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code with intelligent code completion
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and property-based testing with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck
- **Rich Ecosystem** - Access to thousands of JVM libraries and the entire [Scala ecosystem](https://index.scala-lang.org/)
- **One Language** - Write everything in Scala 3—no juggling multiple languages, tools, or paradigms

Scalus is a development platform made for professionals and businesses who value productivity, type safety, and code quality.
