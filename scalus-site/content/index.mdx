# Build Cardano Smart Contracts and dApps with Scala 3

<Image src="/scalus-logo-dark.png" alt="Scalus - Cardano Development Platform for Scala" width={400} height={400} style={{ display: 'block', margin: '1rem auto' }} />

**Scalus** is a development platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a unified environment where developers can write both on-chain smart contracts and off-chain logic using [Scala 3](/docs/language-guide/scala3) - a modern, expressive, and type-safe functional programming language.

## Why Choose Scalus for Cardano Development?

### One Language, Full Stack
Write smart contracts and application logic in Scala 3. No context switching between Plutus/Aiken for contracts and JavaScript/Python for frontends and backends.

### Type-Safe by Design
Catch errors at compile time, not on-chain. Leverage Scala's powerful type system to prevent entire classes of bugs before deployment.

### Professional Tooling
Debug validators with breakpoints in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code. Step through execution, inspect variables, and use the tools you already know.

### Battle-Tested Ecosystem
Built on the JVM with access to thousands of proven libraries. Use ScalaTest for testing, Akka for concurrency, and the entire Scala ecosystem.

### Fine-Grained Control
Advanced optimizations give you control over generated UPLC code. Reduce script size and execution costs with macros, inline optimizations, and direct Script Context access.

## Full Development Lifecycle for Cardano

Scalus supports the complete development workflow for Cardano applications:

- **Write** - [Cardano smart contracts in Scala 3](/docs/smart-contract/developing-smart-contracts) that compile to UPLC
- **Optimize** - Use [advanced optimization techniques](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations) to reduce on-chain costs
- **Debug** - [Debug validators](/docs/testing/debugging) as regular Scala code with your IDE's debugger
- **Build** - [Construct transactions](/docs/transactions) with the transaction builder and evaluate them off-chain
- **Integrate** - Seamlessly integrate on-chain and off-chain components in your full-stack application
- **Test** - [Test thoroughly](/docs/testing) with unit, integration, and property-based tests
- **Deploy** - Verify on testnet and deploy production-ready applications to mainnet with confidence

## Modern Development Experience

Built for professional developers and teams, Scalus provides:

- **Industry-Standard IDEs** - Full support for IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code with intelligent code completion
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and property-based testing with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck
- **Rich Ecosystem** - Access to thousands of JVM libraries and the entire [Scala ecosystem](https://index.scala-lang.org/)
- **One Language** - Write everything in Scala 3—no juggling multiple languages, tools, or paradigms

Scalus is a development platform made for professionals and businesses who value productivity, type safety, and code quality.
