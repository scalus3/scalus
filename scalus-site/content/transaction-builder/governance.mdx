# Cardano Governance: Delegate to DRep, Vote

Scalus TxBuilder provides comprehensive support for Cardano's Conway era governance features. ADA holders can participate in on-chain governance by delegating voting power to Delegated Representatives (DReps) or by becoming DReps themselves.

<Callout type="info">
  Governance operations are part of the Conway era upgrade. These features enable decentralized decision-making for the Cardano protocol.
</Callout>

## Delegating Voting Power to DReps

Delegate your voting power to a Delegated Representative (DRep) to participate in Cardano governance decisions.

```scala copy
val drep = DRep.KeyHash(drepKeyHash)

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .delegateVoteToDRep(stakeAddress, drep)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

### DRep Types

Scalus supports multiple DRep delegation options:

```scala copy
DRep.KeyHash(keyHash)           // Specific DRep
DRep.ScriptHash(scriptHash)     // Script-based DRep
DRep.Abstain                    // Abstain from voting
DRep.NoConfidence               // Vote no confidence
```

**Script-based DReps** enable programmatic voting aligned with community policies or institutional strategies, allowing automated governance participation.

## Registering Stake Keys and Delegating to DRep

Combine stake registration and DRep delegation in a single transaction:

```scala copy
val drep = DRep.KeyHash(drepKeyHash)
val deposit = Coin.ada(2)

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .registerAndDelegateVoteToDRep(stakeAddress, drep, deposit)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

<Callout type="info">
  This requires the standard 2 ADA stake registration deposit, which is refundable upon deregistration.
</Callout>

## Delegating to Stake Pool and DRep

Delegate both your staking power (to a stake pool) and voting power (to a DRep) simultaneously:

```scala copy
val poolId = PoolKeyHash.fromHex("pool1...")
val drep = DRep.KeyHash(drepKeyHash)

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .delegateToPoolAndDRep(stakeAddress, poolId, drep)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Post-Chang Era**: Delegating to a DRep is required to withdraw staking rewards. See [Staking Operations](/docs/transaction-builder/staking-operations) for more details.
</Callout>

## Registering and Delegating to Both

Register your stake key and delegate to both a stake pool and DRep in one efficient transaction:

```scala copy
val poolId = PoolKeyHash.fromHex("pool1...")
val drep = DRep.KeyHash(drepKeyHash)
val deposit = Coin.ada(2)

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .registerAndDelegateToPoolAndDRep(stakeAddress, poolId, drep, deposit)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

<Callout type="info">
  Combining operations saves transaction fees and simplifies the user experience.
</Callout>

## Becoming a Delegated Representative (DRep)

### Registering as a DRep

To become a DRep and accept voting delegation, you need to register with a stake address:

```scala copy
val drepCredential = Credential.KeyHash(yourKeyHash)
val deposit = Coin.ada(500)
val anchor = Some(Anchor(
  url = "https://example.com/drep-metadata.json",
  dataHash = metadataHash
))

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .registerDRep(drepCredential, deposit, anchor)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

<Callout type="warning">
  DRep registration requires a **500 ADA deposit**, which is significantly higher than the stake registration deposit. This deposit is refundable upon deregistration.
</Callout>

The `anchor` parameter is optional but recommended. It should point to metadata describing your governance positions, credentials, and voting philosophy.

### Updating DRep Metadata

Update your DRep metadata to reflect changes in your governance positions or credentials:

```scala copy
val newAnchor = Some(Anchor(
  url = "https://example.com/updated-metadata.json",
  dataHash = newMetadataHash
))

val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .updateDRep(drepCredential, newAnchor)
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```

### Unregistering as DRep

Unregister your DRep credential and reclaim your 500 ADA deposit:

```scala copy
val tx = TxBuilder(env)
  .unregisterDRep(drepCredential, Coin.ada(500))
  .complete(provider, sponsorAddress)
  .build()
```
