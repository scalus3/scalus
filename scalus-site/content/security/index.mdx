# Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts on Cardano are immutable once deployed. Understanding security principles and common vulnerabilities is essential for writing secure validators.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Security First:** Always audit your contracts, test thoroughly, and consider professional security reviews before deploying to mainnet with significant value.
</Callout>

## Authorization

- Always verify signatures for state-changing operations
- Use `tx.signatories.contains(expectedSigner)` checks
- Implement multi-sig where appropriate

## Input Validation

- Validate all datum and redeemer inputs
- Check value composition and amounts
- Verify data structure sizes are bounded

## Fail Secure

- Design validators to reject by default
- Use explicit `require()` checks for all conditions
- Provide clear error messages

## Comprehensive Testing

- Test success paths
- Test all failure cases
- Test boundary conditions
- Test with unauthorized actors
- Use property-based testing

## Audit and Review

- Peer review all validator code
- Professional audits for high-value contracts
- Run bug bounties on testnet
- Consider formal verification for critical logic

## Summary

Writing secure Plutus validators requires careful attention to:

1. **Value validation** - Control what tokens and amounts your script accepts
2. **Authorization** - Always verify signatures and permissions
3. **Concurrency** - Design for EUTxO model constraints
4. **Oracle security** - Use TWAP, multiple sources, and freshness checks
5. **Mint validation** - Explicitly check minting amounts and conditions
6. **Transaction validation** - Verify all transaction components
7. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage including attack scenarios

Security is not optional in smart contract development. Study [common vulnerabilities](/docs/security/common-vulnerabilities), apply mitigations, and test exhaustively before mainnet deployment.
