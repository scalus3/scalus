- ✓ Validator logic and on-chain execution
- ✓ Plutus Core and script evaluation

You'll learn:
- **Scala 3 fundamentals** - Just enough to write validators
- **Type-safe development** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Professional debugging** - Use IDE breakpoints, not trace logs
- **Familiar concepts** - Datums, redeemers, and script context in Scala

<Callout type="info">
**Time Investment:** ~4-6 hours to productivity, ~2-3 days to proficiency
</Callout>

## Your Journey in 4 Steps

### Step 1: Quick Start (30-45 minutes)

**Goal:** Get your first Scalus validator running and see it work in your IDE

<Steps>
#### Setup

- [ ] **[Install Scalus](/docs/get-started)** - Set up Scala, SBT, and your development environment

#### First Contract
- [ ] **[Write your first smart contract](/docs/smart-contracts/developing-smart-contracts)** - Build a "Hello, Cardano!" spending validator
- [ ] **[Debug in your IDE](/docs/testing/debugging)** - Set breakpoints and step through validator execution

**🎯 Quick Win:** You'll have a working validator and see it execute step-by-step in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code. No more blind `trace` debugging!

<Callout type="success">
**What You Just Learned:**
- Scalus validators look familiar (datums, redeemers, script context)
- But you can debug them like regular code with breakpoints
- The `@Compile` annotation marks code for on-chain compilation
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Common Questions from Cardano Devs

### "Do I really need to learn Scala?"

**Short answer:** Yes, but not all of it.

You need ~10% of Scala to be productive:
- Basic syntax (vals, defs, case classes)
- Pattern matching (you already know this concept from Plutus)
- Collections (List, Map)
- Type annotations

That's it. You can learn this in 2-3 hours and be writing validators.

### "How different is Scalus from Aiken/Plutarch?"

**Conceptually:** Almost identical. Datums, redeemers, script context, validators - all the same.

**Syntactically:** Different, but familiar patterns:

| Concept | Aiken | Scalus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Type annotation | `value: Int` | `value: BigInt` |
| Pattern matching | `when` | `match` |
| List operations | `list.filter(fn)` | `list.filter(fn)` |
| Require check | `expect True = ...` | `require(condition, "msg")` |

### "What about debugging?"

This is where Scalus shines:

**Aiken/Plutarch:**
```
trace @"checkpoint 1"  // Hope you see this in logs
trace @"value" value   // Print debugging
```

**Scalus:**
```scala
// Set breakpoint in IDE
val owner = datum.to[PubKeyHash]  // ← Breakpoint here
// Step through, inspect variables, see call stack
```

You get **real debugging** with IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.

### "Is it production-ready?"

Yes. Scalus validators compile to standard Plutus Core and run on Cardano mainnet just like any other Plutus script.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

<Callout type="warning">
**Pitfall #1: Trying to use unsupported Scala features**

**Problem:** Not all Scala features compile to UPLC (e.g., mutable vars, try-catch, complex type classes).

**Solution:** Always check [Supported Features](/docs/language-guide/support) before using advanced Scala features.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Pitfall #2: Forgetting the `@Compile` annotation**

**Problem:** Your validator runs in Scala but doesn't compile to UPLC.

**Solution:** Always annotate validator objects with `@Compile`:
```scala
@Compile  // ← Don't forget this!
object MyValidator extends Validator
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Pitfall #3: Using Scala standard library directly**

**Problem:** Scala's `scala.collection.List` doesn't exist on-chain.

**Solution:** Use Scalus types: `scalus.prelude.List`, `scalus.builtin.ByteString`, etc.
</Callout>
