# Advanced Smart Contract Optimisations

Optimize your Cardano validators to reduce script size and execution costs. This section covers advanced techniques to make your smart contracts more efficient on-chain.

## Why Optimize?

On Cardano, validators consume blockchain resources:
- **Memory usage** - Affects transaction fees
- **CPU execution steps** - Limited per transaction
- **Script size** - Larger scripts cost more to deploy and execute

Optimization reduces these costs, making your DApp more economical for users.

## Optimization Techniques

- **[Macros](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations/macros)** - Inline constants and conditional code generation at compile-time
- **[Direct Script Context Access](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations/script-context)** - Efficiently extract specific fields without full deserialization
- **[Scalus Intermediate Representation (SIR)](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations/sir)** - Understand and optimize the compilation pipeline
- **[UPLC Optimizations](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations/uplc)** - Apply low-level optimizations to reduce execution costs

## When to Optimize

1. **After functionality is correct** - Get it working first, then optimize
2. **When hitting limits** - Transaction size or execution budget constraints
3. **For production deployment** - Reduce user costs and improve UX
4. **Iteratively** - Profile, optimize, measure, repeat
