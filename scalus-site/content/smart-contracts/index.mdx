# Cardano Smart Contract Development

Build type-safe smart contracts for Cardano using Scala. Debug validators with breakpoints in your IDE, test with ScalaCheck, and compile to Plutus Core.

## Tutorials

- **[Build Your First Validator](/docs/smart-contracts/developing-smart-contracts)** — Create a spending validator, write tests, and debug step-by-step
- **[Compiling to Plutus](/docs/smart-contracts/compiling)** — Generate scripts, blueprints, and parameterized validators

## Validators

- **[Validator Types](/docs/smart-contracts/validators)** — Spending, minting, rewarding, and certifying validators
- **[FromData Derivation](/docs/smart-contracts/from-data)** — Type-safe conversion between Scala and Plutus Data

## Testing & Debugging

- **[Unit Testing](/docs/testing/unit-testing)** — ScalusTest trait and property-based testing with ScalaCheck
- **[Debugging](/docs/testing/debugging)** — Breakpoints, logging, and IDE debugger integration

## Production

- **[Security](/docs/security)** — Common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them
- **[Optimizations](/docs/smart-contracts/optimisations)** — Reduce script size and execution costs
- **[Design Patterns](/docs/design-patterns)** — Patterns for multi-input validators
