# Cardano Smart Contract Design Patterns

Proven patterns for building efficient and secure Cardano smart contracts, implemented in Scalus.

## Optimization Patterns

Reduce execution costs by delegating computation to single-execution endpoints:

- **[Withdraw Zero](/docs/design-patterns/withdraw-zero)** — Delegate computation to staking scripts using the "withdraw zero trick", reducing costs from O(N²) to O(N)
- **[Transaction Level Minting](/docs/design-patterns/transaction-level-minting)** — Couple spend and mint endpoints so spending validators stay minimal
- **[Merkelized Validator](/docs/design-patterns/merkelized-validator)** — Read verified data from stake validator redeemers for efficient batch operations

## Validation Patterns

- **[Parameter Validation](/docs/design-patterns/parameter-validation)** — Verify that script instances across a multi-script protocol are parameterized with expected values

## Indexing Patterns

- **[UTxO Indexer](/docs/design-patterns/utxo-indexer)** — Map inputs to outputs using pre-computed indices for O(1) on-chain verification

## Data Structures

- **[Linked List](/docs/design-patterns/linked-list)** — Ordered and unordered linked lists using NFTs and datums for on-chain state management

## Utilities

- **[Validity Range](/docs/design-patterns/validity-range)** — Normalize time ranges to simplify interval validation in your contracts
