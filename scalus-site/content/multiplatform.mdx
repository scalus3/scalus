# Scalus Multiplatform — Cardano on JVM, JavaScript, and Native

Scalus compiles to **JVM**, **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, and **Native** from the same Scala 3 codebase. Write once, deploy anywhere — from server-side backends to browser wallets to CLI tools.

## When to Use Which Platform

### JVM — Full DApp Development

The JVM platform provides the complete Scalus stack:

- **Smart contract development** with the compiler plugin (Scala 3)
- **Transaction building** with TxBuilder
- **Local testing** with Emulator and Yaci DevKit
- **Integration** with Bloxbean Cardano Client Library
- **Production backends** with mature JVM ecosystem

**Best for:** Backend services, full DApp development, integration testing, production deployments.

### JavaScript/TypeScript — Offchain & Browser

JavaScript/TypeScript enables Scalus in Node.js and browser environments:

- **Script evaluation** — Run Plutus V1/V2/V3 scripts
- **Transaction building** — Construct and sign transactions
- **Wallet integration** — Works with Lucid Evolution
- **Cost estimation** — Calculate execution units offchain
- **Browser DApps** — Full offchain logic in the browser

See the [`scalus` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scalus) for JavaScript/TypeScript API, installation, and usage examples.

**Best for:** Browser wallets, Node.js tooling, Lucid-based DApps, offchain computation.

### Native — CLI & Embedded

Scala Native compiles to native binaries:

- **Fast startup** — No JVM warmup
- **Small footprint** — Standalone executables
- **System integration** — FFI to C libraries

**Best for:** CLI tools, embedded systems, static libraries.
