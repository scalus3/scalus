# Advanced Smart Contract Optimisations

This section covers advanced topics in Scalus that help you optimize your on-chain code, access specific data efficiently, and understand the underlying compilation process.

Scalus provides powerful features:

- **[Macros](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations/macros)** - Inlining constants and conditional code generation
- **[Direct access to Script Context fields](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations/script-context)**
- **[Scalus Intermediate Representation (SIR)](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations/sir)** for debugging
- **[UPLC optimizations](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations/uplc)** to reduce script size and execution costs

These advanced techniques allow you to write more efficient validators that consume less memory and execution units on the Cardano blockchain.
