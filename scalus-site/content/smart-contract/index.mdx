# Cardano Smart Contracts

Scalus enables you to build type-safe, debuggable smart contracts for Cardano using Scala. Write validators in familiar Scala syntax, test them with standard tooling, and compile directly to Plutus Core bytecode.

This section covers everything from writing your first validator to advanced optimization techniques for production-ready contracts.

## Getting Started

- **[Developing Smart Contracts](/docs/smart-contract/developing-smart-contracts)** - Write your first Cardano validator step-by-step. Learn about spending validators, datums, redeemers, and how to test your contracts.

## Core Concepts

- **[Validators in Depth](/docs/smart-contract/validators)** - Understand different validator types (spending, minting, rewarding, certifying) and how they work on Cardano.
- **[FromData Derivation](/docs/smart-contract/from-data)** - Automatic conversion between Scala types and Plutus Data for type-safe datum and redeemer handling.

## Development Workflow

- **[Testing](/docs/smart-contract/testing)** - Property-based testing with ScalaCheck, using the `ScalusTest` trait, and creating robust test scenarios.
- **[Debugging](/docs/smart-contract/debugging)** - Debug validators as regular Scala code using your IDE's debugger, breakpoints, and logging.
- **[Compiling](/docs/smart-contract/compiling)** - Transform Scala validators into Plutus scripts, generate contract blueprints, and handle parameterized validators.

## Advanced Topics

- **[Advanced Optimisations](/docs/smart-contract/optimisations)** - Macros, direct Script Context access, SIR debugging, and UPLC optimisations to reduce script size and execution costs.
