# Learning Resources

<Callout type="warning">
**Note:** This section is being updated frequently with new patterns and best practices.
</Callout>

## Tutorials

Hands-on guides for building complete applications:

- **[Scalus Starter](/docs/learning/scalus-starter)** - Build a complete token minting DApp with smart contracts, transaction building, REST API, and testing

## Security

Essential security knowledge for smart contract development:

- **[Plutus Vulnerabilities](/docs/learning/plutus-vulnerabilities)** - Common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them

## Design Patterns

Proven patterns for building efficient and secure Cardano smart contracts.

### Optimization Patterns

Reduce execution costs by delegating computation to single-execution endpoints:

- **[Stake Validator](/docs/design-patterns/withdraw-zero)** - Delegate computation to staking scripts using the "withdraw zero trick"
- **[Transaction Level Minter](/docs/design-patterns/transaction-level-minting)** - Couple spend and mint endpoints for minimal spend costs
- **[Merkelized Validator](/docs/design-patterns/merkelized-validator)** - Read verified data from stake validator redeemers for batch operations

### Validation Patterns

Verify script instances and parameters across multi-script protocols:

- **[Parameter Validation](/docs/design-patterns/parameter-validation)** - Verify script instances are parameterized with expected values

### Indexing Patterns

Efficiently map inputs to outputs using off-chain computed indices:

- **[UTxO Indexer](/docs/design-patterns/utxo-indexer)** - Match inputs to outputs with O(1) on-chain verification

### Data Structures

On-chain data structure implementations:

- **[Linked List](/docs/design-patterns/linked-list)** - Ordered and unordered linked lists using NFTs and datums

### Utilities

Helper patterns for common validation tasks:

- **[Validity Range Normalization](/docs/design-patterns/validity-range)** - Simplify time range validation with normalized intervals
